Implements a Types custom field for YouTube videos and the Types shortcode to access them.

== Description ==
This plugin is unnecessary as its provides a subset of the functionality of the built-in ‘Embedded Media’ custom field which uses the oEmbed API which is a much better and more reliable way of doing this than what I am doing in this plugin. I apologize for my stupidity. If anyone knows how to delete a plugin from the repository please advise. Magenta Cuda
